register allocation
R0
R1  - the constant 1
R2  - count number of space characters added so far (can be used for something else when prepend done)
R3  - bit position when getting parity (can be used for something else outside of parity)
R4  - register anded with input for bit isolation
R5  - keep track of parity bit
R6  - input string for parity (can be used for something else outside of parity)
R7  - the constant 7
R8
R9  - the constant 127
R10 - number of space characters (can be allocated for something else after prepend)
R11 - 0x20 (the ascii space character)
R12 - LSFR tap pattern
R3  - LSFR start state
